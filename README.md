# Roots

[WIP] Roots is a solid foundation for building an enterprise production application.

## Structure

It uses [Chakra UI](https://chakra-ui.com/) for the UI components, [React Query](https://react-query.tanstack.com/) for data fetching and caching and [React Router](https://reactrouter.com/) for routing.

### Backend
